JavaScript To-Do List & Real-Time Digital Clock

This repository contains two primary JavaScript applications: a To-Do List and a Real-Time Digital Clock. Both are simple, functional web applications designed for personal use, combining task management and a live clock display.
Features
To-Do List

    Add tasks: Users can input tasks and add them to a list.
    Edit tasks: Users can edit any task directly from the list.
    Remove tasks: Tasks can be deleted individually.
    Mark tasks as complete: Clicking on a task will toggle a "line-through" effect to visually indicate completion.
    Local Storage: All tasks are saved in the browserâ€™s local storage and persist even after the page is refreshed or closed.

Real-Time Digital Clock

    Current Time: Displays the current time in a 12-hour format (with leading zeroes for single-digit hours, minutes, and seconds).
    AM/PM Indicator: Displays either AM or PM based on the current hour.
    Day of the Week: Highlights the current day in yellow.
    Real-Time Updates: The clock updates every second, reflecting real-time changes.

    Usage
To-Do List

    Type your task in the input box and press the "ADD" button.
    Edit tasks by clicking the "Edit" button next to the task. The task will appear in the input box for editing.
    Delete tasks by clicking the "Remove" button.
    Mark tasks as completed by clicking directly on the task text.

Real-Time Clock

    The digital clock will automatically display the current day and time, with the day highlighted and the time in 12-hour format.
